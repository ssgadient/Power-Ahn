# Inspiration for Power Ahn
Was there ever a time in which you werenâ€™t buried in piles and piles of class work and assignments to finish by a certain deadline? No, exactly. Finishing tasks on time takes a tremendous level of productivity to do, and that is what we want to help with. With the right schedule, timer, and features to promote task productivity levels, we went ahead and created a desktop app that helps one stay on top of their deadlines and due dates with just the simple click of a button.

# Preconditions
- Requires a Windows Operating System
- Requires an executable file to download and use.

# How To Use
Insert a task name, start time, end time, and system application name. When the start time arrives, the application will automatically open the provided system application (such as Visual Studio Code or Word) and set a timer to start counting down on the UI until the end time.


# Next Steps
We will work on improving the design and usability of the application's user interface. Additionally, we are planning using the Google Calendar API to incorporate into our user interface so users can see when and where their tasks are on a digital calendar.
